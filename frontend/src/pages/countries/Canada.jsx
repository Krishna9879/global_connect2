  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "What is Express Entry and how does it work?",
      answer: "Express Entry is Canada’s points-based system for managing applications for permanent residence under three programs: Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP), Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP), and Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Candidates create a profile with factors like age, education, work experience, and language skills to receive a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. The highest-scoring candidates receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) during regular draws, typically every two weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the language requirements for Canadian immigration?",
      answer: "Most programs require a minimum Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) level. For Express Entry, CLB 7 (IELTS 6.0 in each band) is typically needed for FSWP and CEC, while FSTP may require CLB 5 for reading/writing and CLB 4 for listening/speaking. Study permits require proof of language proficiency (e.g., IELTS 6.0+), depending on the institution. Higher scores can boost your CRS points significantly."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to process a Canadian visa or PR application?",
      answer: "Processing times vary: Study permits take 10-12 weeks, work permits (TFWP) 10-20 weeks, Express Entry PR applications 6-12 months, and family sponsorships 12-24 months. Times depend on application completeness, program demand, and biometrics/medical exam scheduling."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)?",
      answer: "The PNP allows Canadian provinces and territories to nominate candidates for PR based on local labor market needs. Each province has streams (e.g., skilled workers, entrepreneurs) with specific criteria. A nomination adds 600 CRS points in Express Entry, virtually guaranteeing an ITA, or you can apply directly through a province."
    },
    {
      question: "How can international students transition to permanent residence?",
      answer: "International students can apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) after completing their studies, valid for up to 3 years based on program length. Gaining Canadian work experience through the PGWP can qualify them for the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) under Express Entry or a PNP stream. High language scores and a Canadian degree further boost CRS points."
