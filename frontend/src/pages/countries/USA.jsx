    {
      question: "What is the difference between a US visa and status?",
      answer: "A visa is an entry document issued by a US consulate abroad that allows you to travel to a US port of entry. Status refers to your legal category while in the US and the permissions it grants (e.g., to study or work). You can maintain status even after a visa expires, as long as you remain in the US legally."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to get a US visa?",
      answer: "Processing times vary significantly by visa type and application location. Student visas (F/M) typically take 2-8 weeks, work visas like H-1B can take 3-6 months (or 15 days with premium processing), and family-based green cards can take 1-2 years for immediate relatives and 2-20+ years for family preference categories."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I work in the US on a student visa?",
      answer: "F-1 students can work on-campus up to 20 hours per week during the academic year and full-time during breaks. After the first academic year, F-1 students may qualify for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT), allowing off-campus employment related to their field of study. STEM graduates can extend OPT for up to 36 months total."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the pathways to permanent residence in the US?",
      answer: "Common pathways include family sponsorship by US citizens or permanent residents, employment-based sponsorship by US employers, investment (EB-5 program), asylum/refugee status, and the Diversity Visa lottery. Each pathway has specific eligibility requirements and processing times."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the H-1B visa lottery work?",
      answer: "The H-1B visa has an annual cap of 85,000 visas (65,000 regular cap + 20,000 for US master's degree holders). When USCIS receives more petitions than available visas, they conduct a random selection process (lottery). Registrations are submitted in March, selections are announced in April, and selected petitions can be filed starting in April for an October 1 start date."
